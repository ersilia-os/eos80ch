# Antimalarial activity (ABS and sexual stages)

Prediction of the antimalarial potential of small molecules using data from various chemical libraries that were
screened against the asexual and sexual (gametocyte) stages of the parasite. Several
compoundsâ€™ molecular fingerprints were used to train machine learning models to recognize stage-specific
active and inactive compounds.
